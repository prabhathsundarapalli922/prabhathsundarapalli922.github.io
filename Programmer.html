            <p>Ever since I was a child, I have always been fascinated by technology and the endless possibilities it holds. As I grew older, I realized that the key to unlocking these possibilities and creating something truly innovative is through programming. The thought of being able to bring my ideas to life through code and making a tangible impact on the world has always been incredibly exciting to me.<br>

                I remember being in grade school and learning how to code basic programs on my family's computer. At first, it was just a fun hobby, but as I continued to learn and challenge myself, I became more and more passionate about it. I would spend hours reading articles and watching tutorials, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and improve my skills.
